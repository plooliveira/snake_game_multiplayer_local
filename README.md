# Snake game / Multiplayer local xD
A fun project made in p5Js !

I made this project as a challenge. The original idea was to build a game with gosu lib in ruby. But because I use WSL on windows, I had many problems to use it. 

So, I decided to use Javascript with p5Js so as not to give up on the challenge, and I had so much fun! It's not complete, but it's playable.
